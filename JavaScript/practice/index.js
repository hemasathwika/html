//variables
//in 2 ways we can declare variables 
//1st way

//let age = 22
//console.log(age)

//2nd way

//const salary = 20000
//console.log(salary)

//difference between those 2 ways is
//we can declare "let" without initializing a value whereas we cannot declare "const" without initializing if we do so we will get typerror
//example as follows

//let sum
//sum = 5
//console.log(sum)

//const salary
//salary = 2121
//console.log(salary)
